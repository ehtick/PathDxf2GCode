# PathDxf2GCode

A tool for converting DXFs with tool paths to GCode files.

For documentation, see *PathDxf2GCode-Doku en.pdf.*

-   Right now, this is automatically translated with DeepL.com from the
    German documentation *PathDxf2GCode-Doku.pdf*, which results in
    quite a number of strange translations or outright errors (e.g.,
    *Riss* is translated as *crack* instead of *projection*). When I
    find time, I\'ll do a manual translation.
